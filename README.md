### Some App - An Artificial Neural Networks Project

Before we begin, this code will not work. Because there is no dataset here and the dataset is not pushed to the GitHub repository because of security and novelty reasons.

The aim of this project is to recognize a fall before the fall happens. And the applications for this are many.

#### Steps:
1. Collection of data using smartwatch and smartphone
2. Pre-processing the raw data (pre_process.py)
3. Feature identification and feature selection (feature_extraction.py)
4. Feature reduction (feature_reduction.py)
5. Feature reduction part 2 - where even more features are reduced using simple classifiers (feature_reduction_part_2.py)
6. Finally, run simple neural networks and compare the performance of all the algorithms (SVM, Naive Bayes, Backpropagation and LVQ2) (neural_network.py)
